# The Gauntlet Manifesto - extending the strengths of L4D2's game design 


## Horde shooter gameplay that offers dynamic replayability

L4D2 players must react to unpredictable attacks from various special infected classes. 
Gauntlet spawns SI in more unpredictable locations.

>It is this balance of chaos and predictability that retain newbies and veterans alike, as they seek adversity to master their abilities. For many such gamers the vanilla campaign and versus modes cease to challenge their teamwork and individual skill, a craving Gauntlet sates.  
Gauntlet asks the questions of its players that vanilla gameplay so weakly poses.  
 
## Skill based minigames that challenge your multitasking ability

Swarmed by weak minions and mobile sub bosses, where is your focus needed most?  
Gauntlet throws SI in waves at the survivor team, armed with improved AI .
  
> - the charger demands immediate priority with its unique ability to immobilise multiple survivors and being the most durable of all to survive passage through the threat range of the survivors' weapons  
> - jockeys and hunters split individual survivor's focus with their blends of evasion, mobility and durability  
> - smokers have the potential to instantly reduce survivor DPS by 25% by immediately immobilising a survivor  
> - boomers provide effective DPS reduction, eating survivor attention by their appearance in itself and through the spawning of hordes

With these elements Gauntlet forces rapid decision making, making the game more dynamic and stimulating. 
Mistakes will be made, and survival is dependent on the collective ability to cover individual defensive failures. 

### Gauntlet players are afforded control of the difficulty level, empowered to turn up the dial beyond what they believed capable of handling
