# Gauntlet - Extending L4D2's horde shooter game design 
Gauntlet players control the difficulty level. Turn up the dial and test your limits.

## Engage in dynamic gameplay that is highly replayable

L4D2 players must react to unpredictable attacks from various special infected classes. 
Gauntlet spawns SI in more unpredictable locations.

> - It is this balance of chaos and predictability that retain newbies and veterans alike, as they seek adversity to master their abilities. 
> - For many such gamers the vanilla campaign and versus modes cease to challenge their teamwork and individual skill, a craving Gauntlet sates.  
> - Gauntlet asks the questions of its players that vanilla gameplay so weakly poses.  
 
## Challenge your ability to multitask various skill based minigames

Swarmed by weak minions and mobile sub bosses, where is your focus needed most?  
Gauntlet throws SI in waves at the survivor team, armed with improved AI .
  
> - the charger demands immediate priority with its unique ability to immobilise multiple survivors and being the most durable of all to survive passage through the threat range of the survivors' weapons  
> - jockeys and hunters split individual survivor's focus with their blends of evasion, mobility and durability  
> - smokers have the potential to instantly reduce survivor DPS by 25% by immediately immobilising a survivor  
> - boomers provide effective DPS reduction, eating survivor attention by their appearance in itself and through the spawning of hordes
