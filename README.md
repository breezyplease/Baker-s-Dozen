# The Gauntlet Manifesto - evolving the strengths of L4D2 horde shooter game design


## Gameplay that excels in replay value. 

L4D2 players must react to unpredictable attacks from various special infected classes. 
Gauntlet spawns SI in more unpredictable locations with adjustable settings.

>It is this balance of chaos and predictability that new players return for and that veterans continually seek increasingly towards the side of adversity as they master fundamental game play patterns. For many such gamers the vanilla campaign and versus modes cease to challenge their teamwork and individual skill, thus is born the core cravings sated by the custom game mode Gauntlet. In doing so, Gauntlet asks the question of its players that vanilla game play so weakly poses.  
 
## Challenging your ability to multitask

Swarmed by weak minions and mobile sub bosses, where is your focus needed most?  
Gauntlet throws SI with improved AI at the survivor team in waves - the frequency and compositions of which are entirely customisable
  
> - the charger demands immediate priority with its unique ability to immobilise multiple survivors and being the most durable of all to survive passage through the threat range of the survivors' weapons  
> - jockeys and hunters split individual survivor's focus with their blends of evasion, mobility and durability  
> - smokers have the potential to instantly reduce survivor DPS by 25% by immediately immobilising a survivor  
> - boomers provide effective DPS reduction, eating survivor attention by their appearance in itself and through the spawning of hordes

With these elements Gauntlet forces rapid decision making, making the game more dynamic and stimulating. 
Mistakes will be made, and survival is dependent on the collective ability to cover individual defensive failures. 

### Gauntlet exaggerates the L4D2 narrative by empowering a spawning algorithm that places improved AI en masse in positions far more threatening than vanilla game play.
