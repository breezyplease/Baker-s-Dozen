# The Gauntlet Manifesto


## Horde shooters appeal to the questing desire for immersion and replay value. 

Note how the variability of a set of Special Infected spawns in one L4D2 match keeps players on constant alert for the location of many possible infected classes that threaten them in a meaningful variety of ways. 

>It is this balance of chaos and predictability that new players return for and that veterans continually seek increasingly towards the side of adversity as they master fundamental game play patterns. For many such gamers the vanilla campaign and versus modes cease to challenge their teamwork and individual skill, thus is born the core cravings sated by the custom game mode Gauntlet.

Gauntlet asks the question of its players that vanilla game play so weakly poses.  
 
## "Swarmed by weak minions and mobile sub bosses, where is your focus needed most?"

Each special infected class asks this question in their own way.
  
> - the charger demands immediate priority with its unique ability to immobilise multiple survivors and being the most durable of all to survive passage through the threat range of the survivors' weapons  
> - jockeys and hunters split individual survivor's focus with their blends of evasion, mobility and durability  
> - smokers have the potential to instantly reduce survivor DPS by 25% by immediately immobilising a survivor  
> - boomers provide effective DPS reduction, eating survivor attention by their appearance in itself and through the spawning of hordes

It is the potential of these threats which in multiplicity force rapid decision making, providing a base for stimulating, dynamic game play. Mistakes will be made, and survival is dependent on the collective ability to cover individual defensive failures. 

### Gauntlet exaggerates this narrative by empowering a spawning algorithm that places improved AI en masse in positions far more threatening than vanilla game play.
